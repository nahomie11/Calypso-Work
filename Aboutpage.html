    <p class="demo2">My name is Yarel Fernández Negrón and I am a Puerto Rican
        woman with a lot of passion in my heart. When Im not at
        school studying at La escuela de Artes  de  Plásticas I
        like to read, dance and go to my beautiful islands beaches.
        My passion for art, education and all beautiful things has
        lead me on a path of self discovery that has made me more
        sensible of my surroundings, my spirituality and my
        emotions. Along that path is where Calypso Avenue was
        created.The main goal of Calypso Ave  is to incorporate
        my art in everyday-wear with beautiful, non-tarnishing,
        handmade jewelry with meaning, purpose, and good vibes.
        Calypsos avenue’s intentions is to make your inner beauty 
        shine and to complement and protect your aura with beautiful
        semi-precious stones. Calypso Avenue is more than just
        jewelry, is passion, and attitude, magic and art.</p>
